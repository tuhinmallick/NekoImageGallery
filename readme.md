An online AI image search engine based on the Clip model and Qdrant vector database. Supports keyword search and similar
image search.

[‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](readme_cn.md)

## ‚ú® Features

- Use the Clip model to generate 768-dimensional vectors for each image as the basis for search. No need for manual
  annotation or classification, unlimited classification categories.
- OCR Text search is supported, use PaddleOCR to extract text from images and use BERT to generate text vectors for
  search.
- Use Qdrant vector database for efficient vector search.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Deployment

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Deployment

#### Choose a metadata storage method

##### Qdrant Database (Recommended)

In most cases, we recommend using the Qdrant database to store metadata. The Qdrant database provides efficient
retrieval performance, flexible scalability, and better data security.

Please deploy the Qdrant database according to
the [Qdrant documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/). It is recommended to use Docker for
deployment.

If you don't want to deploy Qdrant yourself, you can use
the [online service provided by Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/).

##### Local File Storage

Local file storage directly stores image metadata (including feature vectors, etc.) in a local SQLite database. It is
only recommended for small-scale deployments or development deployments.

Local file storage does not require an additional database deployment process, but has the following disadvantages:

- Local storage does not index and optimize vectors, so the time complexity of all searches is `O(n)`. Therefore, if the
  data scale is large, the performance of search and indexing will decrease.
- Using local file storage will make NekoImageGallery stateful, so it will lose horizontal scalability.
- When you want to migrate to Qdrant database for storage, the indexed metadata may be difficult to migrate directly.

#### Deploy NekoImageGallery

1. Clone the project directory to your own PC or server, then checkout to a specific version tag (like `v1.0.0`).
2. It is highly recommended to install the dependencies required for this project in a Python venv virtual environment.
   Run the following command:
    ```shell
    python -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install PyTorch. Follow the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the torch
   version suitable for your system using pip.
   > If you want to use CUDA acceleration for inference, be sure to install a CUDA-supported PyTorch version in this
   step. After installation, you can use `torch.cuda.is_available()` to confirm whether CUDA is available.
4. Install other dependencies required for this project:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Modify the project configuration file inside `config/`, you can edit `default.env` directly, but it's recommended to
   create a new file named `local.env` and override the configuration in `default.env`.
6. Run this application:
    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```
   You can use `--host` to specify the IP address you want to bind to (default is 0.0.0.0) and `--port` to specify the
   port you want to bind to (default is 8000).  
   You can see all available commands and options by running `python main.py --help`.
7. (Optional) Deploy the front-end application: [NekoImageGallery.App](https://github.com/hv0905/NekoImageGallery.App)
   is a simple web front-end application for this project. If you want to deploy it, please refer to
   its [deployment documentation](https://github.com/hv0905/NekoImageGallery.App).

### üêã Docker Deployment

#### About docker images

NekoImageGallery's docker image are built and released on Docker Hub, including serval variants:

Where `<version>` is the version number or version alias of NekoImageGallery, as follows:

| Version           | Description                                                                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `latest`          | The latest stable version of NekoImageGallery                                                          |
| `v*.*.*` / `v*.*` | The specific version number (correspond to Git tags)                                                   |
| `edge`            | The latest development version of NekoImageGallery, may contain unstable features and breaking changes |

In each image, we have bundled the necessary dependencies, `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14` model
weights, `bert-base-chinese` model weights and `easy-paddle-ocr` models to provide a complete and ready-to-use image.

The images uses `/opt/NekoImageGallery/static` as volume to store image files, mount it to your own volume or directory
if local storage is required.

For configuration, we suggest using environment variables to override the default configuration. Secrets (like API
tokens) can be provided by [docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/).

#### Prepare `nvidia-container-runtime` (CUDA users only)

If you want to use CUDA acceleration, you need to install `nvidia-container-runtime` on your system. Please refer to
the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu) for installation.

> Related Document:

> 2. https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker
> 3. https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/

#### Run the server

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file from repository.
   ```shell
   # For cuda deployment (default)
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hv0905/NekoImageGallery/master/docker-compose.yml
   # For CPU-only deployment
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hv0905/NekoImageGallery/master/docker-compose-cpu.yml && mv docker-compose-cpu.yml docker-compose.yml
   ```
2. Modify the docker-compose.yml file as needed
3. Run the following command to start the server:
    ```shell
    # start in foreground
    docker compose up
    # start in background(detached mode)
    docker compose up -d
    ```

### Upload images to NekoImageGallery

There are serval ways to upload images to NekoImageGallery

- Through the web interface: You can use the web interface to upload images to the server. The web interface is provided
  by [NekoImageGallery.App](https://github.com/hv0905/NekoImageGallery.App). Make sure you have enabled the
  **Admin API** and set your **Admin Token** in the configuration file.
- Through local indexing: This is suitable for local deployment or when the images you want to upload are already on the
  server.
  Use the following command to index your local image directory:
  ```shell
   python main.py local-index <path-to-your-image-directory>
  ```
  The above command will recursively upload all images in the specified directory and its subdirectories to the server.
  You can also specify categories/starred for images you upload, see `python main.py local-index --help` for more
  information.
- Through the API: You can use the upload API provided by NekoImageGallery to upload images. By using this method, the
  server can prevent saving the image files locally but only store their URLs and metadata.  
  Make sure you have enabled the **Admin API** and set your **Admin Token** in the configuration file.  
  This method is suitable for automated image uploading or sync NekoImageGallery with external systems.
  Checkout [API documentation](#-api-documentation) for more information.

## üìö API Documentation

The API documentation is provided by FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI. You can access the API documentation by visiting
the `/docs` or `/redoc` path of the server.
